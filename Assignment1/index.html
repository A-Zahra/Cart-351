<h3 class="about">CART351 NETWORKS AND NAVIGATION <br /> About me</h3>

<p>Hi! My name is Zahra and I am studing Computation Arts at Concordia University. Actually, if I want to introduce myself, I like to start with my personality traits like being organized, motivated, determined and talented. Next, it would be great to mention my high school degree that is literature diploma.
  But, now this question may occur to your mind that based on studying literature at high school why did I choose to study Computation Arts at university? The answer is here, having a strong interest in art, especially in painting and drawing, since I was a little child. There fore, this strong tendency towards art and being an artist led me to start participating in
  extracurricular painting courses which resulted in achievment of four remarkable skills including: pastel drawing, black pencil drawing, colorful pencil drawing and oil painting. More over, after applying for my bachelor program, I decided to increase my computer skills; like, learning to work with some art-related-softwares( 3D MAX, Auto CAD).
  And now for more familiarity with me, I think looking at a number of my main goals in my life can be useful. Honestly, being beneficial and influential in my society is my foremost goal. And secondly, applying all available facilities to move my society one more step toward a rosy future has the most importance in my priority list. As conclusion,
  I have a deep belief in this saying from Antoine Chekhov: a person is who they believe they are. I am doing my best to bring this saying to the realm of reality in my life. What about you? </p>
